/**
 * Layer 1 automated accessibility verification — Book 16 §3.2 ("axe-core, broad and shallow").
 *
 * **Dev/test ONLY.** `axe-core` is MPL-2.0 (weak/file-level copyleft), admitted at the dev
 * tier and never shipped in Caelum's published package
 * (`provenance/allowlist.json` › `devCopyleftExceptions`; grounding
 * `research/notes/a11y-testing-tooling.md`). This file lives outside every secondary
 * entry point (no `ng-package.json`) and is excluded from the library build, so the
 * copyleft never reaches Caelum's distributed source.
 *
 * axe is **broad and shallow**: it catches the mechanical WCAG class — missing accessible
 * names, invalid ARIA, duplicate ids — in milliseconds. A green run is the *floor*, never
 * the proof (§3.2); keyboard operability (Layer 2, the CDK harness) and screen-reader
 * semantics (Layer 3) are verified separately.
 *
 * jsdom has no layout engine, so axe reports layout-dependent rules (e.g. `color-contrast`)
 * as `incomplete`, **not** as `violations` — this helper asserts on `violations` only, so it
 * never false-fails on a rule jsdom cannot evaluate. Real-browser contrast across light/dark
 * and parity density rides on the `@axe-core/playwright` harness (#240).
 *
 * **mat-form-field controls (input/textarea/select/…):** name them via `ariaLabel` in a Layer 1
 * spec, not the visible `[label]`. Material's MDC floating label is CSS-positioned, so with no
 * stylesheet applied axe judges the (correctly `for`-associated) `<label>` as *hidden* and the
 * `label` rule false-fires. `ariaLabel` puts a direct, CSS-independent accessible name on the
 * inner control; the visible-label path is verified in the real browser (#240).
